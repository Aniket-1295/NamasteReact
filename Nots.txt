#interesting thing  about npm 
npm does not stands for node package manager (npm does not have a full form)
it manages the  installed package but it does not stand for node package manager. 
behand the scense it works as  a node package manager 

#package.json

package.json is a configuare of npm.
it keeps and manage  the installed dependensies with there approx version. 
it gives the information about aour project like name version 
packages also known as dependensies  

#Bundler  -- bundels our app and get ready to production

--webpack
--parsal

so whatever is in my local are present in the production
